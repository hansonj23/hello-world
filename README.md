<!--> Reference Implementation featuring-->

Reference Implementation featuring Spring MVC capabilities and features

## Installing / Getting started

To run this application you'll need Tomcat 8.5/Java 8.

<!--
```shell
commands here
```-->
WHAT'S HERE? Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above. - Obviously nothing yet.  Theres nothing to run!

## Developing

### Built With
Spring Core, Spring Web, Spring MVC, Sitemesh, Hibernate, H2, Sentry UI Template

### Prerequisites - ANYTHING?
<!-- Anything here? What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.-->


### Setting up Dev

* Check out the project from SVN along with the <a href="http://svn4.sentry.com:8080/svn/Community/CommonBuild/tags/4.0.1/CommonBuildAnt">CommonBuildAnt</a> project.
* Resove Ivy Dependencies
* Ensure any Build Path Issues are resolved.  Expects jdk8 JRE System Library and tomcat8dev Tomcat System Libraries.
* Create a Tomcat instance and Build/Deploy
* Start Tomcat
* Navigate to http://localhost:<port>/
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.


## Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.
Documents your database design and schemas, relations etc... 

<!--## Licensing

State what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.-->
